# COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis

*This is our final project for UCLA's CS 263 Natural Language Processing course.*

## Description

For this project, we developed several sentiment classifcation models including logistic regression, SVM, CNN, and LSTM. Having trained our sentiment classifiers, we analyze and compare their peformance. Lastly, using our classifier, we predict the sentiments of COVID-19 related tweets and analyze how sentiment towards COVID-19 trends over time on Twitter.
